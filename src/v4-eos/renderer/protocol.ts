// Message protocol between the CMS shell (parent) and the preview renderer

// section-selected back out. The renderer is a SEPARATE document (renderer.html)
// so the customer output is truly decoupled from the CMS chrome — the analog of
// the SSR renderer service, client-rendered here since GitHub Pages can't host
// a server.
